"""Comparing environment snapshots.

The comparison is deliberately conservative. Three outcomes are distinguished
because they demand different responses:

``UNCHANGED``  the resource is verifiably identical
``CHANGED``    the resource is verifiably different
``UNKNOWN``    we could not tell


``UNKNOWN`` is not a softer ``UNCHANGED``. A resource that could not be
inspected — an API that timed out, a file that is now unreadable — must not be
treated as intact just because nothing contradicted it. Recovery downgrades on
uncertainty rather than assuming the best.
